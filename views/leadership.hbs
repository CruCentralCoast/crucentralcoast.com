            <p>As we select leaders for our different movements, we are looking for four things to be present in our
                applicants.
                These traits include being Faithful, a Leader, Available, and Teachable; or as we abbreviate it: <span
                    class="list">FLAT</span>.
                Here's what we mean:</p>
            <p><span class="list">Faithful:</span> Being an active member in the movement you are applying for
                leadership with and committing to the responsibilities for the leadership position.</p>
            <p><span class="list">Leader:</span> Being a person of influence with a willingness to focus on the needs of
                others.</p>
            <p><span class="list">Available:</span> Willing to commit to being a part of a Community Group with Cru
                Central Coast as well as events, conferences, and leadership activities sponsored by your movement
                within Cru Central Coast.</p>
            <p><span class="list">Teachable:</span> Having a desire to grow and a desire to receive input and feedback
                from others regarding your leadership.</p>
            <p>As you consider leadership with Cru Central Coast, know that we are not looking for the "perfect" leader
                who has it all together,
                but rather someone willing to learn, grow, and pay attention to the needs of others.</p>

                    entail. Remember to look at the movement that you are involved in as that is where it makes the most

            <div class="sites">
                <p>The Leadership Application is your first step toward applying for leadership with Cru Central Coast.
                    The application opens on Monday, March 4th, 2019 and will remain open until the deadlines set by
                    each movement
                    (see Position Descriptions for exact dates).</p>

                <p>After you turn in your application, Staff members will review it and schedule an interview either in
                    person or on the phone.
                    As we are reviewing many applications, please allow time for Staff to review and schedule your
                    interview.
                    While the Staff are responsible for reviewing your application, it is the student leadership teams
                    of each movement that will make final decisions on placement.
                    Even if the Staff member passes on your application for placement, you may still not be placed as
                    many people may have applied.</p>
